## PID_omega_coeffs
Function to calculate the coefficients of the omega function power series from the statistical moments of a random variable for the sum of identically distributed reduced random variables.

PID_omega_coeffs.py calculates new coefficients, which are saved to Kcoeffs_list.txt, so they never have to be calculated again.
